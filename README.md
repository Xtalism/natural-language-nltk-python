# Natural Language Processing with NLTK and Python

A project focused on building a natural language-based chat application using NLTK.

## 📋 Overview

This project leverages NLTK to create a chat application capable of understanding and responding to natural language inputs. Key features include:

- Text tokenization and sentence segmentation
- Part-of-speech (POS) tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Dependency parsing
- Morphological analysis
- Lemmatization
- Text classification and sentiment analysis

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in natural language conversations with the application
- **Token Exploration**: Examine individual tokens and their linguistic properties
- **Entity Recognition**: Identify and classify named entities in user inputs
- **Linguistic Properties**: Extract morphological, syntactic, and semantic information
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze user sentiment to tailor responses

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.3 or higher
- Ubuntu 24.04 (or any Linux distribution)
- pip package manager

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xtalism/natural-language-nltk-python.git
cd natural-language-nltk-python
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# or
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -U nltk
python -m nltk.downloader all
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

Run the main chat application:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will:

1. Initialize the chat application

2. Allow users to interact with the application using natural language inputs
